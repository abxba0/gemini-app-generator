# ü§ñ Gemini App Generator

A powerful, AI-driven application generator that leverages Google's Gemini AI to create complete, production-ready applications from natural language prompts. Generate React frontends, Node.js backends, Python applications, and more with just a simple description of what you want to build.

## ‚ú® Features

- **AI-Powered Generation**: Uses Google Gemini AI to generate complete applications from natural language descriptions
- **Multiple Frameworks**: Supports React, Node.js, Vue.js, Python, and full-stack applications
- **Docker Environment**: Fully containerized development environment with all necessary tools pre-installed
- **Production-Ready Code**: Generates complete applications with proper error handling, security, and best practices
- **Automatic Dependencies**: Installs all required dependencies and sets up the project structure
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface with helpful prompts and examples

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## üõ† Supported Application Types

| Type | Description | Technologies |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `react` | Frontend applications | React, Create React App, modern CSS |
| `node` | Backend APIs and services | Express.js, security middleware, validation |
| `vue` | Vue.js frontend applications | Vue 3, Vue CLI, composition API |

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your Google AI API key (required)
- `NODE_ENV`: Development environment setting (default: `development`)
- `PYTHONPATH`: Python path configuration (default: `/workspace`)

### API Key Setup

You can set your API key in several ways:

1. **During setup** (recommended):
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   # Follow the prompts to enter your API key
   ```

2. **Environment variable**:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **`.env` file**:
   ```bash
   echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
   ```

## üèó Architecture

The Gemini App Generator consists of several key components:

### Core Scripts
- **`setup.sh`**: Automated setup and configuration
- **`scripts/app-generator.sh`**: Main application generation logic
- **`scripts/gemini-config.sh`**: Gemini AI configuration and testing

### Docker Environment
- **`Dockerfile`**: Container definition with all necessary tools
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Multi-service orchestration
- Pre-installed tools: Node.js, Python, development frameworks

### Generated Applications
- Applications are created in the `projects/` directory
- Each app includes complete source code, dependencies, and documentation
- Ready-to-run with appropriate start commands

## üê≥ Docker Environment

The development environment includes:

### Pre-installed Tools

## üéØ Tips for Better Results

### Writing Effective Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Include details about features, UI/UX preferences, and functionality
   ```bash
   # Good
   "Todo app with drag and drop, dark theme, and local storage"
   
   # Better
   "Modern todo application with drag-and-drop reordering, dark/light theme toggle, local storage persistence, and responsive design for mobile"
   ```

2. **Mention Technologies**: Specify preferred libraries or frameworks
   ```bash
   "REST API using Express.js with JWT authentication and MongoDB"
   ```

3. **Include Requirements**: Mention specific features or constraints
   ```bash
   "E-commerce frontend with shopping cart, user authentication, and payment integration"
   ```

### Best Practices

- Review generated code before running in production
- Test applications thoroughly in your environment
- Customize and extend generated code as needed
- Keep your API key secure and never commit it to version control

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Key Problems
```bash
# Error: "GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable is not set"
# Solution: Set your API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
# Or run setup again
./setup.sh
```

#### Docker Issues
```bash
# Error: "Docker is not installed"
# Solution: Install Docker
# Visit: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

# Error: "Docker Compose is not installed"  
# Solution: Install Docker Compose
# Visit: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
```

#### Container Access Issues
```bash
# If you can't access the container
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec gemini-dev bash
```

#### Generated App Issues
```bash
# If npm install fails in generated apps
cd /workspace/projects/your-app
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
