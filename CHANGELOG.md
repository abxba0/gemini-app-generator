### Performance Benchmarks

#### Generation Times (average)
- React applications: 30-60 seconds
- Node.js APIs: 20-45 seconds
- Vue.js applications: 35-55 seconds
- Python applications: 25-50 seconds
- Full-stack applications: 60-120 seconds

*Times may vary based on:*
- Prompt complexity

#### Resource Usage
- Memory: 1-2GB during generation
- CPU: Moderate usage during builds
- Disk: 100-500MB per generated application
- Network: API calls for generation only

### Troubleshooting Quick Reference

#### Common Issues
1. **API Key Issues**: Check environment variable setup
2. **Docker Problems**: Verify Docker installation and permissions
3. **Generation Failures**: Check network connectivity and API limits
4. **Port Conflicts**: Modify docker-compose.yml port mappings
5. **Permission Errors**: Check file system permissions

#### Quick Fixes
- Restart Docker containers: `docker-compose restart`
- Clean rebuild: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
- Reset environment: `./setup.sh`
- Clear generated apps: `app-generator.sh clean`
